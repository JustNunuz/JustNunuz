## Projects

As a cybersecurity professional, I have been involved in various research and blogging projects that demonstrate my expertise in the field. Here are some highlights of my work:

1. **Research: "Optimizing Medical IoT Disaster Management with Data Compression"**

In this research project, I investigated the potential of data compression techniques to optimize the performance of Medical IoT devices during disaster management scenarios. By analyzing various compression algorithms and strategies, I proposed a novel approach to reduce data transmission latency and improve the overall efficiency of Medical IoT systems in high-stress situations. This research has been published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at the annual Digital Futures International Congress (DIFCON 2023) conference.

2. **Blog: "Absolute Z3r0 Exploits"**

I am the creator and chief editor of "Absolute Z3r0 Exploits," a popular cybersecurity blog that covers various topics related to the field. Through my blog, I share my insights, experiences, and opinions on a wide range of subjects, including penetration testing, malware analysis, and security awareness. My goal is to provide readers with engaging and informative content that helps them stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the cybersecurity landscape.
